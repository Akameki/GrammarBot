user: the user to judge

all/new
- all: judge all messages, even messages that have been judged previously

limit: max number of messages containing your/you're (NOT the number of all messages to look through)



TODO:
* stop button in mid judgement
* color code embed for previous verdicts
* help command
* view command
* stats command
* revamp readme
* separate JSON files into servers (or maybe channels as well?)
* investigate JSON alternatives
* command aliasing
* change prefix
* MAYBE add support for other search terms.. probably not for many reasons
